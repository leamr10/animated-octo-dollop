# Module 11 Challenge

This project was designed for us to create a note taking application
where users could create new notes, save them and delete them using 
Express.js on the back end. Our job was to create the back end and the routes
to connect the front end to the back end to get the application properly running.

I was able to accomplish this by:
     -Creating post, get and delete routes to get the application running
     and functioning at an acceptable level
     -Creating a server.js file to create the server and path
     -Creating a helpers folder to carry out the functions needed in application
     such as readFromFile, readAndAppend and readAndRemove

This challenge was a bit simpler for me just because of how frequently we've been
working with routes and CRUD operations. Once you understand the flow of whatever
you're working on, it becomes all about just routing everything to where it needs 
to go. The challenge made me feel more confident in what I've learned from this module.
